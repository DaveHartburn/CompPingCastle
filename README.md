# CompPingCastle
Small web utility for comparing the XML of two PingCastle reports.

Drag and drop the XML output from PingCastle. This small web utility will show you the actual score (if your results are over 100) and when two reports are loaded, it displays the changes between them.

Written in HTML and JavaScript, reports are not uploaded or stored on a server.

Runs fine from a local directory.
